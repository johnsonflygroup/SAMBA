SAMBA (**SAM**2 for **B**ehavioural **A**nalysis) is a user-friendly analysis pipeline for analysing locomotion patterns in model organisms, particualrly *Drosophila melanogaster* larvae.

[Click Here](https://github.com/johnsonflygroup/SAMBA/blob/main/SAMBA_SAM2_Behavioural_Analysis.ipynb) to open SAMBA in Google Colab.

### Getting started
Save a copy of SAMBA to a Google Drive account. Upload video files (.mp4, .mov, .avi, .mkv) to be analysed to the same Google Drive account. The analysis output data will also be written to Google Drive.

### Detailed instructions with screenshots
A full description is available (link) (soon)

### Sample video
A short 10s sample video ('sample_video') is included in this repository to test run SAMBA for yourself.

Where to put it: After step 2.2 Set Main Directory is run for the first time, upload this video to the 'data' folder at your specified directory in Google Drive.
