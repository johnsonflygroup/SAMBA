SAMBA (**SAM**2 for **B**ehavioural **A**nalysis) is a user-friendly analysis pipeline for analysing locomotion patterns in model organisms, particualrly *Drosophila melanogaster* larvae.

[Click Here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/johnsonflygroup/SAMBA/blob/main/SAMBA_SAM2_Behavioural_Analysis.ipynb) to open SAMBA in Google Colab.

### Getting started
Save a copy of SAMBA to a Google Drive account. Upload video files (.mp4, .mov, .avi, .mkv) to be analysed to the same Google Drive account. The analysis output data will also be written to Google Drive.

### Detailed instructions with screenshots
A full description is available (link) (soon)

### Sample videos
Short 10s sample videos (in the [sample_video](https://github.com/johnsonflygroup/SAMBA/tree/main/sample_videos) folder) are included in this repository to test run SAMBA for yourself.

Where to put them: After Step 2.2, Set Main Directory is run for the first time, upload videos to the `data` folder at your specified directory in Google Drive.
