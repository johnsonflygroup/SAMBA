## Documentation
SAMBA (SAM2 for Behavioural Analysis) is a user-friendly analysis pipeline for annotating locomotion for model organisms, particualrly Drosophila melanogaster larvae.

The colab notebook 'SAMBA - SAM2 Behavioural Analysis.ipynb' is available at [link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1n05Hxsw4RREBY34t_g3Hj0txsaof8pNh?usp=sharing](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1n05Hxsw4RREBY34t_g3Hj0txsaof8pNh?usp=sharing)

To use, save a copy of SAMBA to a Google Drive account. Input videos must be uploaded to Google Drive and the output will also be written to Google Drive.
